# cut 1
#
# Example:
# 
# A quickie histogram of timestamps; say that for the object in the foo/bar
# directory, field 3 holds a flat timestamp (YYYYmmddHHMMSS) and you want a
# histogram by hour (and that foo/bar is small enough to be worth sucking
# through a single machine):
#
#   hdp-catd foo/bar | cuttab 3 | cutc 12 | sort | uniq -c
#
# If foo/bar is already sorted leave out the call to sort.
# 


#
# Set it to cut up to $1 (if defined), or if not, up to $CUTC_MAX (if defined), or 200 chars as a fallback.
#
CUTC_MAX=${CUTC_MAX-200}
CUTC_MAX=${1-$CUTC_MAX}
cutchars="1-${CUTC_MAX}"
shift

#
# Do the cuttin'
#
exec cut -c"${cutchars}" "$@"
