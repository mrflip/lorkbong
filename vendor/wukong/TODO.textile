* add GEM_PATH to hadoop_recycle_env

* Hadoop_command function received an array for the input_path parameter

** We should be able to specify comma *or* space separated paths; the last
   space-separated path in Settings.rest becomes the output file, the others are
   used as the input_file list.

* Make configliere Settings and streamer_instance.options() be the same
  thing. (instead of almost-but-confusingly-not-always the same thing).
