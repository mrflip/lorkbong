     # AccumulatingReducer makes it easy to apply one operation across all
     # occurrences of each key
     #
     # On each occurrence of a given key, AccumulatingReducer calls
     # accumulate, and at the final occurrence calls finalize.
     #
     # See ListAccumulatingReducer and KeyCountingReducer for examples
     #
     # Make sure you don't have the bad luck, bad judgement or bad approach to
     # accumulate more data than your box can hold before finalizing.
