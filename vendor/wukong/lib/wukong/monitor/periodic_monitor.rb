module Wukong::Monitor
  #
  # Accepts a lightweight call every iteration.
  #
  # Once either a time or an iteration criterion is met, executes the block
  # and resets the timer until next execution.
  #
  # Note that the +time_interval+ is measured *excution to execution* and not
  # in multiples of iter_interval. Say I set a time_interval of 300s, and
  # happen to iterate at 297s and 310s after start.  Then the monitor will
  # execute at 310s, and the next execution will happen on or after 610s.
  #
  # Also note that when *either* criterion is met, *both* criteria are
  # reset. Say I set a time interval of 300s and an +iter_interval+ of 10_000;
  # and that at 250s I reach iteration 10_000.  Then the monitor will execute
  # on or after 20_000 iteration or 550s, whichever happens first.
